# Building High Performance Computing Cluster
Build HPC cluster program utilities
This repository provides a number of handy utilities to aid HPCC network designers.
##Collection of utility programs
### <ins> radix_calculator </ins>
  Is a program to artificially calculate the switch radix based upon the number of compute nodes, the desired spine and leaf switches.
### <ins> gpu_calculator </ins>
  Is a program that determines the number of GPU's it'll take based upon the GPUs VRAM, the size of the LLM
### <ins> power_calculator </ins>
  Is a program that calculates the power consumption of the cluster based upon the input, output, power supply efficiency and switch type.  It also determines the cost of running the cluster.
